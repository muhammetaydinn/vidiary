Video Diary App
Objective
Develop a React Native Video Diary App where users can:
• Import videos,
• Crop a specific segment of 5 seconds,
• Add details such as name and description,
• Save cropped videos to a list for future reference.
The app should prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and scalability, adhering to modern React Native development practices.
Case Study Requirements
Main Features
• Step 2: Video Cropping
• Display the video with a scrubber allowing users to select the start and end points for a 5-second segment.
• Below the scrubber, include a button to proceed to the next step.
• Step 3: Add Metadata
• Include two input fields:
• Name (text input),
• Description (text area).
• Add a button to execute the cropping operation.
Bonus Features
. Main Screen: Cropped Video List
• Display a list of previously cropped videos.
• Implement persistent storage (e.g., Zustand with AsyncStorage or an alternative state management solution).
• Allow users to tap a video in the list to navigate to the Details Page.
. Details Page
• Display the selected video with its:
• Name,
• Description.
• Keep the UI minimalistic, focusing on the video and its associated metadata.
. Crop Modal
• Step 1: Video Selection
• Allow users to select a video from their device.
. Video Cropping
• Implement video cropping functionality using FFMPEG.
• The FFMPEG script should execute via Tanstack Query, ensuring asynchronous operations and a robust API
integration.
Required Technologies
• Core Technologies
• Expo: Base framework for React Native development.
• Expo Router: For implementing app navigation.
• Zustand: State management solution.
• Tanstack Query: To manage async logic and the FFMPEG cropping process.
• FFMPEG: Core library for video processing.
• NativeWind: Styling solution.
• Expo Video: Video rendering and playback (or any suitable alternative).
• Bonus Technologies
• Expo SQLite: For structured, persistent storage.
• React Native Reanimated: For animations.
• Zod/Yup: Validation schemas for form handling.
Key Considerations
Deliverables
• A functional React Native app with all specified features.
• Bonus features (if implemented) for enhanced functionality.
• Clean and modular codebase adhering to best practices.
• Documentation for setup and usage instructions.
. Edit Page (Optional)
• Add a page allowing users to edit the Name and Description of a cropped video.
• Include a form with two inputs:
• Name
• Description
• Persist updates to storage.
. Enhancements
• Use Expo SQLite for storing and reading video data.
• Integrate React Native Reanimated for smoother animations.
• Use Zod or Yup for form input validation.
. Scalability
• Ensure the app can handle a growing list of cropped videos efficiently.
• Abstract key features into reusable components (e.g., VideoPlayer, MetadataForm).
. Performance
• Optimize video cropping using FFMPEG.
• Use efficient libraries like Tanstack Query to handle background processing.
. Usability
• Simplify navigation and UX design for intuitive user interactions.
• Use NativeWind for clean and responsive styling.
. Validation
• Use Zod or Yup to validate user inputs for metadata (e.g., Name and Description).
